With plugins, you, the CLI developer, are able to split out commands between global CLI and project specific CLI commands. Imagine, at some point, you'll notice that certain commands need to be separately evolved to run apace to a certain project. Or, you'll need different commands for different project types. So, instead of creating different versions of your one global CLI, with plugins, you could split out the local and global commands to their own packages. Plugins allow for version matching of a project's specialized CLI commands to different versions or types of projects. As you can imagine, this enables you to build very intricate CLIs.

Take, for instance, the scenario where you might need to build your own data seeding or data initialization scripts, where they only need to be ran once to start off a project. Running these scripts are perfect as CLI commands. And, instead of you creating new modules or having to copy code just for the CLI commands to gain access to your database layer to do the work, you simply use the same modules already built for your project, leveraging all of the great advantages Nest's DI system has to offer, at the same time.
